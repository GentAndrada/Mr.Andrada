I am Gent Martin Ong Andrada, 19 years old. 
I am born and raised in Sampaloc, Manila, but we oftentimes go to our province in Bulacan, La Union, or in Samar. 
I like doing sports, playing video games, eating, and watching movies
Ever since I was a child, I have always been interested in military but circumstances didn't allow me to enlist. 
My motto in life: "A winner is just a loser, who tried one more time"
